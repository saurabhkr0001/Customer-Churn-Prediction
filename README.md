# Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. It performs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
feature engineering, and model building using Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Machine Learning Model: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)
- Insights to reduce customer churn

## 📁 Project Structure
- `Customer_Churn.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis and model building steps.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset files (if any).
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required to run the project.
